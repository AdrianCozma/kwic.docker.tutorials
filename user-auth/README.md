The gateway can be configured with user authentication.  A user is authenticated at the HTTP layer prior to the WebSocket handshake completing.

There are several ways to configure user authentication, including:

* [Authorization File](file)
* LDAP (example coming soon)
* Custom Login module (example coming soon)
* Kerberos (example coming soon)
